Once FDA approved vaccine, ACIP held meeting to review data and make recommendations
On Dec 1st, recommended that in phase 1a, vaccinations should be offered to HC personnel and residents of long term care facilities
Before making recommendations, ACIP reviews all available clinical trial info
Goals with limited supply: decrease death and serious disease, preserve functioning of society, reduce the extra burden the disease is having on people already facing disparities
4 ethical principles to guide decisions: 1) maximize benefits and minimize harm 2) mitigate health inequities 3) promote justice 4) promote transparency
Prior to making recommendations, considered four groups to recommend for early vaccination: 1) HC personnel 2) Workers in essential and critical industries 3) people with underlying medical conditions 4) people {\textgreater}65},

	abstract = {Seasonal influenza affects millions of people across the United States each year. African Americans and Hispanics have significantly lower vaccination rates, and large-scale campaigns have had difficulty increasing vaccination among these two groups. This study assessed the feasibility of delivering a flu vaccination promotion campaign using influencers, and examined shifts in social norms regarding flu vaccine acceptability after a social media micro influencer campaign. Influencers were asked to choose from vetted messages and create their own original content promoting flu vaccination, which was posted to their social media pages. Content was intentionally unbranded to ensure that it aligned with the look and feel of their pages. Cross-sectional pre- and post-campaign surveys were conducted within regions that received the campaign and control regions to examine potential campaign impact. Digital metrics assessed campaign exposure. Overall, 117 influencers generated 69,495 engagements. Results from the region that received the campaign showed significant increases in positive beliefs about the flu vaccine, and significant decreases in negative community attitudes toward the vaccine. This study suggests that flu campaigns using a ground-up rather than top-down approach can feasibly reach at-risk groups with lower vaccination rates, and shows the potentials of using an influencer-based model to communicate information about flu vaccination on a large scale.},

	doi = {10/ghq7vp},
	abstract = {Present hopes to conquer the Covid-19 epidemic are largely based on the expectation of a rapid availability of vaccines. However, once vaccine production starts, it will probably take time before there is enough vaccine for everyone, evoking the question how to distribute it best. While present vaccination guidelines largely focus on individual-based factors, i.e. on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first, e.g. to risk groups or to individuals with a strong social-mixing tendency, here we ask if a strategic spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines, e.g. to prioritize certain cities, can help to increase the overall survival rate of a population subject to an epidemic disease. To this end, we propose a strategy for the distribution of vaccines in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with the most new cases of infection during a certain time frame and compare it with the standard practice of distributing vaccines demographically. Using a simple statistical model we find that, for a locally well-mixed population, the proposed strategy strongly reduces the number of deaths (by about a factor of two for basic reproduction numbers of [Formula: see text] and by about 35\% for [Formula: see text]). The proposed vaccine distribution strategy establishes the idea that prioritizing individuals not only regarding individual factors, such as their risk of spreading the disease, but also according to the region in which they live can help saving lives. The suggested vaccine distribution strategy can be tested in more detailed models in the future and might inspire discussions regarding the importance of spatiotemporal distribution rules for vaccination guidelines.},

During the 2018-2019 flu season, less than four in ten Black (39\%), Hispanic (37\%), and AIAN (38\%) adults were vaccinated compared to nearly half of White adults (49\%)
The lower vaccination rates among adults of color, in part, reflect their higher uninsured rates.
uninsured individuals either need to pay out-of-pocket for the vaccine or identify sites, such as clinics or health centers, that are offering it for free
uninsured adults were less likely to be vaccinated compared to those with private coverage. Medicaid and private similar
Research also shows that distrust, safety concerns, and experiences with discrimination and other factors contribute to disparities in vaccination rates
African American adults perceive a higher risk of side effects from the seasonal flu vaccine, have less knowledge about the vaccine, and have less trust in the vaccine.

In a convenience sample of HIV-positive Black Americans, we examined associations of COVID-19-related medical mistrust with COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 treatment hesitancy and negative impacts of COVID-19 on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence.
METHODS: Participants were 101 HIV-positive Black Americans (age: M = 50.3 years; SD = 11.5; 86\% cisgender men; 77\% sexual minority) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a community-based ART adherence intervention in Los Angeles County, CA. From May to July 2020, participants completed telephone interviews on negative COVID-19 impacts, general COVID-19 mistrust (eg, about the government withholding information), COVID-19 vaccine and treatment hesitancy, and trust in COVID-19 information sources. Adherence was monitored electronically with the Medication Event Monitoring System.
RESULTS: Nearly all participants (97\%) endorsed at least one general COVID-19 mistrust belief, and more than half endorsed at least one COVID-19 vaccine or treatment hesitancy belief. Social service and health care providers were the most trusted sources. Greater COVID-19 mistrust was related to greater vaccine and treatment hesitancy [b (SE) = 0.85 (0.14), P {\textless} 0.0001 and b (SE) = 0.88 (0.14), P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively]. Participants experiencing more negative COVID-19 impacts showed lower ART adherence, assessed among a subset of 49 participants [b (SE) = -5.19 (2.08), P = 0.02].
DISCUSSION: To prevent widening health inequities, health care providers should engage with communities to tailor strategies to overcome mistrust and deliver evidence-based information, to encourage COVID-19 vaccine and treatment uptake.},

Hypothesis: greater mistrust would be associated with greater hesitancy. We also hypothesized that negative COVID-19-related impacts would be associated with lower antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence.
Participants: 103 participants were reached during the time frame (May-July, 2020), and 101 participants completed the 15-20 minutes COVID-19 telephone interview; 33 participants could not be contacted after multiple attempts and 2 participants declined
Outcome variables: General covid-19 mistrust: 10-item tool (mistrust in PH, withholding cure, etc); vaccine and treatment hesitancy (would not want to get it, would not trust it, etc); trust in information sources (HC providers, fed gov't); ART adherence (Medication Event Monitoring System: measured doses taken)
Results: high levels of general COVID-19 mistrust and high levels of hesitancy related to treatment and a future vaccine (Table 2). Nearly all (97\%) endorsed at least one mistrust belief. The most prevalent general mistrust beliefs (endorsed by about half or more than half) concerned withholding information or a lack of honesty by the government. More than half of participants showed hesitancy regarding a COVID-19 future vaccine or treatment across the items, with about a third saying they would not get vaccinated or treated
greater trust in HC providers than the government (a fifth said black people cannot trust providers); least trusted was federal government, including the US president, followed by social media
less than a HS education showed higher levels of covid-19 mistrust, vaccine hesitancy and treatment hesitancy
Greater mistrust associated with greater vaccine heistancy and Tx hesitancy

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior research has highlighted racial and ethnic disparities in H1N1 vaccination in the United States. Our study adds to this literature by utilizing an intersectionality framework to examine the joint influence of race and sex on H1N1 vaccination beliefs and behaviors among non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites (hereafter blacks and whites).
METHODS: Using data from the National H1N1 Flu Survey of U.S. adults, we measured differences in beliefs about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine among black women, black men, white women, and white men. We then estimated a series of nested logistic regression models to examine how race/sex vaccination disparities were influenced by health beliefs, socioeconomic status (SES), pre-existing conditions, and healthcare.
RESULTS: Black respondents were more likely than white respondents to express reservations about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine. Consistent with those beliefs, white females reported the highest rate of H1N1 vaccination (28.4\%), followed by white males (26.3\%), black males (21.6\%), and black females (17.5\%). Differences in health beliefs, SES, pre-existing conditions, and healthcare explained lower odds of H1N1 vaccination among white men and black men, relative to white women. However, black women experienced 35-45\% lower odds of vaccination than white women across all models, highlighting the intersectional nature of these associations.
DISCUSSION: The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provides a cautionary tale about the distribution of new vaccines across large populations with diverse racial, sex, and socioeconomic characteristics. Despite differences between the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics, our study warns that many black Americans will forego COVID-19 vaccines unless swift action is taken to address black-white disparities in access to vital resources. Public health stakeholders can also encourage widespread adoption of COVID-19 vaccines by tailoring health promotion messages for different groups of racial minorities, especially groups like black women who face intersecting disadvantages.},

investigation found that race and sex combined to produce important differences in vaccination uptake and beliefs during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
when controlling for demographic variables, socioeconomic status, chronic conditions, healthcare status, and health beliefs about H1N1, black females were less likely than white females (and other groups) to receive the H1N1 vaccine.
Additional knowledge regarding black-white disparities in vaccination behavior—and how this varies among men and women—is essential to minimize unequal uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S.
the strongest predictor of H1N1 vaccine uptake was a physician’s recommendation.
Even though physicians’ recommendations did not eliminate black-white vaccination disparities in our H1N1 analyses, especially among black women, recent improvements in health insurance coverage among blacks could, if sustained, facilitate contact with health care professionals who are likely to recommend properly vetted vaccines, including COVID-19, in the future
public health stakeholders could encourage widespread adoption of COVID-19 vaccines by continuing to educate Americans about the considerable health risks presented by this novel coronavirus—and by tailoring these health promotion messages for different groups of racial minorities, including black Americans.
There is an urgent need to promote covid-19 in communities of color
2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic nevertheless offers a cautionary tale about the distribution of new vaccines across large populations with diverse racial, sex, and socioeconomic characteristics
accounting for differences in educational attainment and marital status substantially reduced vaccination disparities between black males and white females
Understanding the causes of vaccine hesitancy during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic may help public health stakeholders reduce the disease burden created by COVID-19, particularly among black Americans and other racial/ethnic minorities.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Research on HPV vaccine coverage in the United States has typically aggregated Hispanic/Latinx individuals into a single group for analyses, an approach that has potentially masked variation between Hispanic/Latinx subgroups. To address this limitation, we examined HPV vaccine coverage across Hispanic/Latinx subgroups.
METHODS: We analyzed data on Hispanic/Latinx adolescents ages 13-17 (n = 16,335) from the 2012-2016 National Immunization Survey-Teen. Each adolescent was categorized into a subgroup: Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central American, South American, other Spanish origin, or multi-subgroup. We examined HPV vaccine initiation (receipt of one or more doses) and completion (receipt of three doses) for males and females separately. Analyses used weighted logistic regression.
RESULTS: Vaccine coverage among males was highest among Central Americans (initiation: 57.5\%; completion: 31.1\%) and lowest among multi-subgroup males (initiation: 46.3\%; completion: 19.9\%). Among females, initiation ranged from 63.4\% among Cubans to 71.2\% among Puerto Ricans, and completion ranged from 33.6\% among multi-subgroup females to 48.7\% among South Americans. Hispanic/Latinx subgroups were similar on these outcomes in regression models. However, within several subgroups, vaccine coverage was higher among adolescents whose parents' preferred language was Spanish (i.e., potentially less acculturated) compared to those whose parents' preferred language was English.
CONCLUSIONS: Modest variation in HPV vaccine coverage exists across Hispanic/Latinx subgroups, with differences found by preferred language within several subgroups. Findings provide insight into HPV vaccine coverage among Hispanic/Latinx subgroups and can help guide future surveillance efforts and vaccination interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Transmission of the human papillomavirus (HPV) is a significant public health concern. HPV is preventable through a series of vaccinations; however, knowledge gaps exist as to which groups are least likely to initiate vaccination. Considering this gap, the aim of this study is to examine HPV vaccine initiation rates in racial minorities, comparing foreign-born individuals to their American-born peers.
STUDY DESIGN: Population-based data from the 2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a repeated large-scale household interview survey of a statistically representative sample of the United States civilian non-institutionalized population, were applied. Data were derived from two survey modules: the family and summary adult modules.
METHODS: Sampling weights were employed to logistic regression modelling the outcome of HPV vaccine initiation.
RESULTS: Foreign-born persons, African Americans, males, those lacking health insurance coverage and those without a medical home (usual place to receive care) held statistically lower rates of HPV vaccine initiation. Being college educated was associated with higher odds of HPV vaccine initiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the persistence of health disparities in racial minorities and foreign-born persons residing in the United States. Addressing these gaps will likely require both individual-level (e.g. targeted health education) and system-level (e.g. HPV vaccine promoting policies) interventions. Since health insurance coverage and having a medical home were significant associates of HPV vaccine initiation, attempts to coverage may improve HPV vaccine initiation rates. Additionally, policies which require HPV vaccination for school entry could boost coverage across all population groups, including boys, foreign-born persons and racial minorities.},

the aim of this study was to examine HPV vaccine initiation rates in racial minorities, comparing foreign-born individuals to their American-born peers, controlling for personal characteristics such as sex and health insurance coverage.
An HPV vaccine targeting these four types has been available in the United States since 2006 for females and 2009 for males (ages 9-26 years).
Availability of the HPV vaccine has definitively lowered the rate of HPV in the United States
racial minorities are more likely to initiate HPV vaccination but are less likely to complete the regime.
This same poverty consequently constrains the ability to compete the vaccination series due to lack of transportation, rigid work schedules and limited health-care access.
To our knowledge, this is one of the few national assessments, to date, of adult HPV vaccine initiation which disaggregates race and foreign-born status.
Being of African American descent and being foreign-born were associated with lower HPV vaccination
African Americans, regardless of their foreign-born status had a lower rate of HPV vaccine initiation compared to American whites
College education was associated with higher HPV vaccine uptake, lending some support to the notion that lack of education may be a barrier to HPV vaccination
Lack of health insurance coverage and lack of a usual place to seek care were associated with lower rates of uptake.
Interventions designed to increase preventative healthcare utilisation through expanded insurance coverage, such as via the Affordable Care Act, could benefit the population by increasing the rate HPV vaccination
This study has shown foreign-born persons to have lower rates of HPV vaccine initiation, and a portion of this group is likely to lack legal residency status, making them unable to access to health insurance coverage
programmes such as Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which typically cover HPV vaccination in children should be promoted to minority Americans, lowincome groups, and foreign-born individuals, while children are still eligible rather than waiting for sexual maturity at which point they may only qualify for more restrictive adult coverage},

three key opportunities to improve health equity for LEP populations as a result of the COVID-19 public health crisis: 1) patient and clinician language data collection in health systems, 2) linguistically and culturally appropriate public health messaging, and 3) health care workforce communication skills education.
1) Language data collection in health services: propose that accurate and consistent collection of language data about clinicians and patients be enforced in order to facilitate health system preparedness and accountability to meet the communication needs of patients with LEP who are particularly vulnerable to poor health outcomes during limited-resource crisis situations.
2) Linguistically and culturally appropriate public health messaging: We propose that public health departments, health systems, and health policy leaders collaborate with community organizations, patients, and clinicians, to ensure that public health communications are inclusive of the social, cultural, and linguistic realities of minority populations.
3) Health care workforce communications skills education: propose that medical schools and other health professions programs implement and evaluate educational approaches—including virtual strategies—to teach and assess the linguistic and cultural communication skills of medical students and other clinicians as a strategy to improve language-concordant and culturally appropriate care for minorities both during and after the pandemic.
Conclusion: these opportunities have the potential to create a long-lasting impact in health care and medical education systems and to improve health equity for vulnerable linguistic minority communities well beyond the current pandemic.},

Methods: Data were pooled (N=8,759) from the HINTS-FDA (Cycle 1 and 2) and HINTS 5 Cycle 1 surveys: nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized U.S. population 18 years or older
Outcome variables: Question asked was, "In general, how much would you trust information about health or medical topics from each of the following?" The five variables are: 1) doctors 2) family/friends 3) government 4) charitable organizations (red cross), and 5) religious organizations. Examined on 4 point scale: "not at all" to "a lot"
Dependent variables (population characteristics): ethnoracial minorities, foreign born, city vs. rural, english proficiency, sexual orientation
Results: Overall, trust in health information was highest for doctors (95.1\%), followed by governmental agencies(75.3\%), family/friends(58.1\%), charitable organizations(44.0\%), and religious organizations (28.7\%).
Trust in health care providers the same throughout.
But further analysis showed that trust in medical providers lower among minorities marginalized within own communities (foreign-born Latinos and sexual minorities living in rural areas may be suspicious about health information provided by doctors; limited English proficiency associated with lower trust in governmental agencies)
Ethnoracial minorities had higher trust in charitable and religious organizations
Individuals with 2 or more minority groups less likely to trust health information from doctors compared to individuals from one minority group

METHODS: A systematic review of peer reviewed (January 2007-October 2013) and grey literature (up to October 2013) was conducted using a broad search strategy, built to capture multiple dimensions of public trust, confidence and hesitancy concerning vaccines. This search strategy was applied and adapted across several databases and organizational websites. Descriptive analyses were undertaken for 166 (peer reviewed) and 15 (grey literature) evaluation studies. In addition, the quality of evidence relating to a series of PICO (population, intervention, comparison/control, outcomes) questions defined by the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy (WG) was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria; data were analyzed using Review Manager.
RESULTS: Across the literature, few strategies to address vaccine hesitancy were found to have been evaluated for impact on either vaccination uptake and/or changes in knowledge, awareness or attitude (only 14\% of peer reviewed and 25\% of grey literature). The majority of evaluation studies were based in the Americas and primarily focused on influenza, human papillomavirus (HPV) and childhood vaccines. In low- and middle-income regions, the focus was on diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, and polio. Across all regions, most interventions were multi-component and the majority of strategies focused on raising knowledge and awareness. Thirteen relevant studies were used for the GRADE assessment that indicated evidence of moderate quality for the use of social mobilization, mass media, communication tool-based training for health-care workers, non-financial incentives and reminder/recall-based interventions. Overall, our results showed that multicomponent and dialogue-based interventions were most effective. However, given the complexity of vaccine hesitancy and the limited evidence available on how it can be addressed, identified strategies should be carefully tailored according to the target population, their reasons for hesitancy, and the specific context.},

Define vaccine hesitancy and look at the potential causes and determinants of the apparent increase in vaccine hesitancy in developed world. Then, look at determinants of individual decision-making regarding vaccination
need to look at vaccine hesitancy in the historical, political and socio-cultural context
Spectrum of parental decision making in literature (Ex: "accepters", "vaccine-hesitant", "late vacicnators" and "rejecters") in general, have a spectrum of active demand to complete refusal
hesitancy can vary according to the vaccine involved (one can be hesitant regarding the flu vaccine but accept with confidence all other vaccines), with newer vaccines usually engendering more hesitancy
different factors (past experiences with health services, family histories, feelings of control, conversations with friends, etc.) can influence the decisionmaking process regarding vaccination
In the actual postmodern context that questions the legitimacy of science, expertise and medical authority, it is not surprising that more and more individuals question the relevance of vaccination
The rise of the informed patient has shifted the traditional locus of power from doctors as sole directors of patient care to shared decisionmaking between health professionals and patients who want to be active participants in the decision-making process concerning their health
Despite the fact that there are as many causes of hesitancy as there are contexts,we have hypothesized that some factors are playing a key role in the apparent increase of this phenomenon in the developed world.
media have played a role in keeping vaccination scares alive, even in face of strong evidence of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.
Many consider that the omnipresence of anti-vaccination content on the World Wide Web has contributed to a broader and faster dissemination of rumours, myths and “inaccurate” beliefs regarding vaccines that have had a negative impact on vaccine uptake.
most anti-vaccination websites argue against vaccination safety and usefulness, using arguments such as the existence of “hot lots” of vaccines or the presence of poisons in vaccines and use emotive appeals such as personal stories of vaccine damage
there seems to be an increasing trend ofopposition toward mandatory vaccination, as shown for instance by the increase in exemption rates in United States
the importance for public health authorities to work in collaboration with communication experts so that their messages, while being scientifically rigorous, can be effectively communicated to the public and to health-care providers
Dry statements on probabilities are not as powerful as anecdote and emotion often used in anti-vaccination claims.public health communicators move beyond the “knowledge deficit model of communication” to develop messages tailored to the audience needs; to use new tools such as social media and to be proactive rather than reactive to vaccination scares
Vaccine hesitancy among health professionals is also well-illustrated by the reluctance of a significant proportion of healthcare workers to receive the flu vaccine despite strong recommendations to do so and free vaccines available at the workplace in many countries.
importance of maintaining a trustworthy patient-provider relationship and the importance of tailoring the communication to specific patients’ concerns and doubts.
feeling pressured by physicians to vaccinate one’s child was one of the main determinants of a child’s non-vaccination or incomplete vaccine status.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Vaccines represent one of the most important aspects of pediatric preventive care. However, parents are increasingly questioning the safety of and need for vaccines, and as a result, vaccination rates have fallen to dangerously low levels in certain communities. The effects of vaccine hesitancy are widespread. Community pediatricians who interact regularly with vaccine-hesitant parents report higher levels of burnout and lower levels of job satisfaction. Not surprisingly, vaccine hesitancy has also had direct influence on vaccination rates, which in turn are linked to increased emergency department use, morbidity, and mortality.
METHODS: Literature from 1999 to 2017 regarding vaccines and vaccine hesitancy was reviewed.
FINDINGS: Few evidence-based strategies exist to guide providers in their discussions with vaccines-hesitant parents. Recent research has shown a presumptive approach (ie, the provider uses language that presumes the caregiver will vaccinate his or her child) is associated with higher vaccination uptake. Motivational interviewing is a promising technique for more hesitant parents.
IMPLICATIONS: At the community level, evidence-based communication strategies to address vaccine hesitancy are needed. The practice of dismissing families from pediatric practices who refuse to vaccinate is common, although widely criticized. Other controversial and rapidly evolving topics include statewide vaccination mandates and school exemption policies. Electronic interventions, such as text-messaging services and social media, have recently emerged as effective methods of communication and may become more important in coming years.},

Despite, and perhaps because of, their public health impact, an increasing number of parents and patients are choosing to delay or refuse vaccines. These individuals are described as "vaccine hesitant." This phenomenon has developed due to the confluence of multiple social, cultural, political, and personal factors. As immunization programs continue to expand, understanding and addressing vaccine hesitancy will be crucial to their successful implementation. This review explores the history of vaccine hesitancy, its causes, and suggested approaches for reducing hesitancy and strengthening vaccine acceptance.},

Despite dramatic consequences of smallpox, many criticized use of it in early 1800s (leicester anti-vaccination league in 1870s and 1880s)
1902 case (during smallpox epidemic) of Jacobson v. Masachussetts: courts ruled that state could pass laws requiring vaccination in order to protect the public against communicable diseases

push for large worldwide vaccination programs in 1974 by WHO: polio, diphtheria, Tb, pertussis, measles and tetanus (20\% of kids got DTP in 1980, to 75\% in 1990)
mid-1970s publication alleging 36 children suffered serious neuro conditions following DTP vaccine in the UK; despite reassurance with large study, controvery continued

MMR link between vaccine and autism: 90\% in 97 to less than 80\% in 2004 -{\textgreater} lead to measles outbreaks and deaths
cameroon (1990) rumors and fears that administering range of vaccines to sterilize women thwarted effort
The popularization of the Internet at the beginning of the 2000s has offered an unprecedented opportunity for antivaccination activists to diffuse their messages to a much wider audience and recruit new members (spread of misinformation and out of context data)
To summarize, despite changes in time periods, safer and more effective vaccines, as well as enhanced surveillance of adverse events following vaccination, vaccine opposition is still deeply rooted as it was two centuries ago.
Some of the arguments used by the anti-vaccination activists in the 1800s are still used today: vaccines are ineffective or cause diseases; vaccines are used to make profit; vaccines contain dangerous substances; harms caused by vaccines are hidden by the authorities; vaccination mandates violate civil rights; natural immunity is better than immunity induced by vaccines or natural approaches to health and alternative products (e.g., homeopathy, vitamins) are superior to vaccines to prevent diseases
Whereas in the past anti-vaccination activists were mostly proletarians who were opposed to the state intervention in their bodies and their children’s bodies, anti-vaccination groups in today’s world, at least in HIC, are mostly well-educated middle- and upper-income parents who claim the right to make an ‘informed decision’ about vaccination
many antivaccine groups formed by parents who believe that their child has been seriously harmed by vaccine
others lead by people who oppose biomedicine and who sell 'natural solutions' to replace vaccination
internet provides a bigger platform and louder voice than was possible 100 years ago and it offers the potential to reach and infleunce many more parents},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) vaccine acceptance in a minority community including correlates of vaccine hesitancy and refusal. We identified intervention points to increase H1N1 vaccine coverage.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Minority parents and caregivers of children ≤ 18 years participated in a cross-sectional survey. Statistical analyses included bivariate correlations, exploratory factor analyses, internal-consistency assessment, and logistic regressions.
RESULTS: The sample (N = 223) included mostly lower-income (71\% [n = 159]) and black (66\% [n = 147]) participants. Potential and actual receipt of pediatric H1N1 vaccination was low (36\% [n = 80]). Pediatric H1N1 vaccine acceptance was associated with lack of insurance (odds ratio [OR]: 3.04 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.26-7.37]), perceived H1NI pediatric susceptibility (OR: 1.66 [95\% Cl: 1.41-1.95]), child vaccination prioritization in family (OR: 3.34 [95\% CI: 1.33-8.38]), believing that H1N1 is a greater community concern than other diseases (OR: 1.77 [95\% CI: 1.01-3.09]), believing that other methods of containment (eg, hand-washing, masks) are not as effective as the H1N1 vaccine (OR: 1.73 [95\% CI: 1.06-2.83]), and a desire to promote influenza vaccination in the community (OR: 2.35 [95\% CI: 1.53-3.61]).
CONCLUSIONS: We found low acceptance of the H1N1 vaccine in our study population. Perceived influenza susceptibility, concern about H1N1 disease, and confidence in vaccinations as preventive methods were associated with vaccine acceptance. Physician support for HIN1 vaccination will aid in increasing immunization coverage for this population, and health departments are perceived as ideal community locations for vaccine administration.},

target population: English and Spanish-speaking parents and caregivers of children younger than 18 years in Atlanta. 25 locations including churches, bookstores, educational forums, community meetings, and special events such as family health fairs that revealed the potential to recruit an adequate number of participants.
Assessment of intent: “On a scale of 0 (definitely not) to 10 (definitely so), please rank the likelihood of your child(ren) getting a swine (H1N1) flu vaccine in the next 90 days?” Also measured intent to get seasonal flu vaccine. Then dichotomized variables to "definitely will" or "willing"
Primary results: The sample included mostly lower-income (71\%) and black participants. Potential and actual receipt of pediatric H1N1 vaccination was low (36\%). Pediatric H1N1 vaccine acceptance was associated with lack of insurance, perceived H1NI pediatric susceptibility, child vaccination prioritization in family, believing that H1N1 is a greater community concern than other diseases, believing that other methods of containment (eg, hand-washing, masks) are not as effective as the H1N1 vaccine, and a desire to promote influenza vaccination in the community.
Conclusion: We found low acceptance of the H1N1 vaccine in our study population. Perceived influenza susceptibility, concern about H1N1 disease, and confidence in vaccinations as preventive methodswere associated with vaccine acceptance. Physician support for HIN1 vaccination will aid in increasing immunization coverage for this population, and health departments are perceived as ideal communitylocations for vaccine administration
Twenty-two percent (n 50) of the parents had had their children vaccinated for seasonal influenza in the previous 3 months. The overall seasonal influenza vaccine-acceptance rate for children was 40.8\%
acceptance of pediatric seasonal influenza vaccination was associated with parents who were younger than the median age (36 years of age), attributed importance of seasonal influenza vaccine compared with other childhood vaccinations such as those against measles-mumps-rubella or polio, perceived child susceptibility to influenza as higher, and had confidence in the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine
significant factors that predicted H1N1 vaccine acceptance for children included lack of insurance, higher perceived child susceptibility to H1N1, prioritizing children over other family members for vaccination, and having the belief that H1N1 is a greater community concern than other diseases
indicate low pediatric influenza vaccination-acceptance rates for both seasonal (40.8\%) and H1N1 (35.9\%) influenza among this group of minority adults
Minority populations less likely to accept immunizations
phenomenon may result from negative vaccine attitudes in the community and poor experiences with health care providers along with general concerns about vaccination.
more comprehensive education of minority parents with regard to childhood risk of influenza morbidity and mortality may provide an intervention option
Those who create prevention messages should be careful not to overemphasize the effectiveness of hand-washing at the expense of vaccinations
Among the black population, negative vaccination attitudes shared by community members may stem from a collective lack of information, misconceptions about immunizations, and a history of unsatisfying health system encounters
physicians have a central leadership role in educating parents about the importance of vaccinations
Moreover, our study results show parental confidence in the health departments to provide H1N1 vaccination compared with other community-based venues
The low level of vaccine acceptance highlightsthe importance of accounting for individual- and community-level concerns to understand the factors that influence parental decision-making on children’s vaccination.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate predictors of vaccination among women who received tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccination (Tdap), influenza vaccination, and Tdap and influenza vaccinations.
STUDY DESIGN: In a retrospective cohort study of all full-term (≥37 weeks gestation) deliveries between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2018 at a single, safety-net institution, we used multinomial logistic regression models to compare predictors of vaccination among women who received Tdap only, influenza only, and both Tdap and influenza vaccines.
RESULTS: Among 3132 full-term deliveries, women were primarily non-Hispanic black (67.5\%), between the ages of 21-34 (65.3\%), and multiparous (76.0\%). The rates of only influenza or Tdap vaccination were 10.3\% and 21.6\%, respectively; 43.3\% of women received both vaccines, and 24.9\% of women did not receive either vaccine. In the adjusted models, Hispanic ethnicity was positively associated with receipt of all types of vaccination and non-Spanish language interpreter use was positively associated with receipt of Tdap vaccination and Tdap and influenza vaccination. A parity of greater than three and inadequate and unknown prenatal care adequacy were negative predictors of all types of vaccination. Pre-existing hypertension was negatively associated with Tdap vaccination, and HIV-positive status was negatively associated with influenza vaccination and Tdap and influenza vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Compared to the national rate of both Tdap and influenza vaccination (32.8\%), a higher proportion of women received both vaccines in our study population. Vaccine uptake may be affected by race/ethnicity, use of interpreter services, parity, pre-existing comorbidities, and prenatal care adequacy. The lower rate of influenza vaccination compared to Tdap vaccination suggests that other factors, such as vaccine hesitancy and mistrust, may be differentially impacting influenza vaccination uptake in our predominantly minority population. Future provider and public health approaches to vaccine promotion should incorporate culturally appropriate strategies that address vaccine-related beliefs and misconceptions.},

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and POPLINE in August 2015 to identify studies of provider communication about HPV vaccination.
RESULTS: We identified 101 qualitative and quantitative studies. Providers less often recommended HPV vaccine if they were uncomfortable discussing sex, perceived parents as hesitant, or believed patients to be low risk. Patients less often received recommendations if they were younger, male, or from racial/ethnic minorities. Despite parents' preference for unambiguous recommendations, providers often sent mixed messages by failing to endorse HPV vaccine strongly, differentiating it from other vaccines, and presenting it as an "optional" vaccine that could be delayed.
CONCLUSION: Interventions are needed to help providers deliver effective recommendations in the complex communication environment surrounding HPV vaccination.},

	abstract = {During the 1918 influenza pandemic, the U.S., unlike Europe, put considerable effort into public health interventions. There was also more geographic variation in the autumn wave of the pandemic in the U.S. compared with Europe, with some cities seeing only a single large peak in mortality and others seeing double-peaked epidemics. Here we examine whether differences in the public health measures adopted by different cities can explain the variation in epidemic patterns and overall mortality observed. We show that city-specific per-capita excess mortality in 1918 was significantly correlated with 1917 per-capita mortality, indicating some intrinsic variation in overall mortality, perhaps related to sociodemographic factors. In the subset of 23 cities for which we had partial data on the timing of interventions, an even stronger correlation was found between excess mortality and how early in the epidemic interventions were introduced. We then fitted an epidemic model to weekly mortality in 16 cities with nearly complete intervention-timing data and estimated the impact of interventions. The model reproduced the observed epidemic patterns well. In line with theoretical arguments, we found the time-limited interventions used reduced total mortality only moderately (perhaps 10–30\%), and that the impact was often very limited because of interventions being introduced too late and lifted too early. San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City had the most effective interventions, reducing transmission rates by up to 30–50\%. Our analysis also suggests that individuals reactively reduced their contact rates in response to high levels of mortality during the pandemic.},

The flu was particularly deadly for young adults without pre-existing conditions, which increased its economic impact relative to a disease that mostly affects the very young and the very old.
The mortality rate varied from 0.3 percent in Australia, which imposed a quarantine in 1918, to 5.8 percent in Kenya and 5.2 percent in India, which lost 16.7 million people over the three years of the pandemic.
The flu killed 550,000 in the United States, or 0.5 percent of the population.
The most common estimate, one third of the population, is based on a 1919 study of 11 US cities; it may not be representative of the US population, let alone the global population. (how many people infected by the virus)
Researchers estimate that in the typical country, the pandemic reduced real per capita GDP by 6 percent and private consumption by 8 percent, declines comparable to those seen in the Great Recession of 2008–2009
In the US, a 1.5\% decline in GDP and a 2.1\% drop in consumption
Countries experiencing the average death rate of 2 percent saw real stock returns drop by 26 percentage points. The estimated drop in the United States was much smaller, 7 percentage points.
“the probability that COVID-19 reaches anything close to the Great Influenza Pandemic seems remote, given advances in public health care and measures that are being taken to mitigate propagation.”
some of the mitigation efforts that are currently underway, particularly those affecting commerce and travel, are likely to amplify the virus’s impact on economic activity.

much of the work assessing vaccine hesitancy, and studies using the PACV (Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccine) specifically, have been pursued in more affluent populations that are predominantly of white race. Question remains if it can be used to identify vaccine hesitancy in different demographic groups
Objective: aim of this study was to determine if the PACV survey could identify influenza vaccine-hesitant caregivers in an urban setting serving a low-income, predominantly minority patient population.
Methods: Cross-sectional study in pediatric primary care center at an urban, tertiary care pediatric institution in Cincinnati, Ohio (clinic is the Pediatric Primary Care Center (PCCC)
Inclusion criteria: child between 6 months and 7 years, no contraindications for the vaccine, English speaking
Scores of surveys: Higher {\textasciitilde} more vaccine hesitancy
Primary outcome question: "do you plan to have your child receive the influenza vaccine this year?
73\% of respondents intended for their child to receive the influenza vaccine. Intent to vaccinate did not significantly differ across any of the measured demographic characteristics of either the caregiver or child
history of a chronic medical condition, including asthma, was not significantly associated with intent to obtain the influenza vaccine
Families who planned to obtain the influenza vaccine had a median PACV score of 33.8; those who did not had a 58.2
The PACV tool was significantly associated with intent to vaccinate in a predominantly minority, low-income primary care population
results from this study are similar with other studies that used the PACV to identify vaccine-hesitant caregivers in more affluent, predominantly Caucasian populations
suggest that the PACV can help in the identification of influenza vaccine-hesitant caregivers in an underserved clinical setting
Vaccine hesitancy factors vary for a given population, important to address the relevant variables that contribute to vaccine hesitancy
concerns regarding potential side effects from immunization were associated with intent to not vaccinate while concerns about the efficacy of the vaccine were not
Main point of study: PACV is a tool that could be used to identify influenza vaccine–hesitant caregivers in a primary care center that serves a largely urban, low income, and minority patient population.},

This persistent disparity contributes to increased influenza-related morbidity and mortality in the African American population. Most scholarship on vaccine disparities has compared Whites and Blacks. Employing Public Health Critical Race Praxis, this study seeks to shift the focus to explore differences within the Black population. Utilizing a nationally-representative 2015 survey of US Black adults (n = 806), we explore differences by gender, age, income, and education across vaccine-related measures (e.g., perceived risk, knowledge, attitudes) and racial factors (e.g. racial salience, racial fairness, perceived discrimination). We also explore differences by vaccine behavior in the past five years among those who vaccinate every year, most years but not all, once or twice, and never. Greater frequency of flu vaccine uptake was associated with better self-reported vaccine knowledge, more positive vaccine attitudes, more trust in the flu vaccine and the vaccine process, higher perceived disease risk, lower perceived risk of vaccine side effects, stronger subjective and moral norms, lower general vaccine hesitancy, higher confidence in the flu vaccine, and lower perceived barriers. Logistic regression results highlighted other significant differences among the groups, emphasizing areas to target for improved vaccination rates. We find great diversity within the Black community related to influenza immunization decisions, highlighting the need to “break down the monolith” in future research.},

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that vaccine hesitancy and any proxy of it should be constantly monitored. Given the growing importance and pervasiveness of information and communication technologies (ICTs), the new media could be exploited in order to track lay-people's perceptions of vaccination in real time, thereby enabling health-care workers to actively engage citizens and to plan ad hoc communication strategies. Analysis of so-called "sentiments" expressed through the new media (such as Twitter) and the real-time tracking of web-related activities enabled by Google Trends, combined with the administration of specific online "surveys" on well-defined themes to target groups (such as health-care workers), could constitute a "Fast data monitoring system" that yields a snapshot of perceptions of vaccination in a given place and at a specific time. This type of dashboard could be a strategic tool that enables public services to organize targeted communication actions aimed at containing vaccine hesitancy.},

	abstract = {Contemporary commentators describe the current period as "an era of fake news" in which misinformation, generated intentionally or unintentionally, spreads rapidly. Although affecting all areas of life, it poses particular problems in the health arena, where it can delay or prevent effective care, in some cases threatening the lives of individuals. While examples of the rapid spread of misinformation date back to the earliest days of scientific medicine, the internet, by allowing instantaneous communication and powerful amplification has brought about a quantum change. In democracies where ideas compete in the marketplace for attention, accurate scientific information, which may be difficult to comprehend and even dull, is easily crowded out by sensationalized news. In order to uncover the current evidence and better understand the mechanism of misinformation spread, we report a systematic review of the nature and potential drivers of health-related misinformation. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus and Google databases to identify relevant methodological and empirical articles published between 2012 and 2018. A total of 57 articles were included for full-text analysis. Overall, we observe an increasing trend in published articles on health-related misinformation and the role of social media in its propagation. The most extensively studied topics involving misinformation relate to vaccination, Ebola and Zika Virus, although others, such as nutrition, cancer, fluoridation of water and smoking also featured. Studies adopted theoretical frameworks from psychology and network science, while co-citation analysis revealed potential for greater collaboration across fields. Most studies employed content analysis, social network analysis or experiments, drawing on disparate disciplinary paradigms. Future research should examine susceptibility of different sociodemographic groups to misinformation and understand the role of belief systems on the intention to spread misinformation. Further interdisciplinary research is also warranted to identify effective and tailored interventions to counter the spread of health-related misinformation online.},

We contend that it is now necessary to integrate the different perspective and methodologies, to understand the characteristics of susceptible populations and to devise interventions that are most effective in countering this spread.
Although refusal of vaccination and movements opposing vaccines date back to the time of Jenner, publication of fraudulent research linking the MMR vaccine to autism and bowel disease was a seminal moment. The concerns raised then, although long since discredited, have been widely disseminated on social media and even now are highly influential among some groups.
widespread misinformation about side effects, as well as mistrust in government or pharmaceutical companies in discussions on vaccination. Krishna's (2017) study of active propagators of these messages found that those who were knowledge-deficient and vaccine-averse exhibit higher levels of activity than those who are not.
the research identifies anti-vaxxer and members of online communities favouring conspiracy theories as sources or propagators of misinformation, with discussions tending to revolve around rhetorical and personal arguments that induce negative emotions (fear, anger, sadness).
existing research finds that misinformation is abundant on the internet and is often more popular than accurate information. Several of the studies address areas where state action challenges individual autonomy. The classic example is vaccination, where effective protection of the population requires achievement of levels of uptake sufficient to achieve herd immunity. This review confirms that misconceptions about MMR vaccine and autism, in particular, remain prevalent on social media
When people are frightened and doubtful, they can be more susceptible to misinformation
politically incorrect to question or criticize the belief of others, and the fight for truth is nevertheless against the flow of true believers armed with ignorance and misinformation
A more constructive approach may be to cultivate critical thinking and to improve health and media literacy, thereby equipping individuals with the faculty to critically assess the credibility of information.}

However, current trends in the US indicate low uptake among all adolescents, with persistent disparities among minority and low-income adolescents despite largely positive views of vaccination among their parents
This article reviews factors associated with HPV vaccine acceptability, uptake, and completion among adolescents of different racial, ethnic, and income groups in the United States.
Since 2006, a quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil® or HPV4) and a bivalent vaccine (Cervarix® or HPV2) have been recommended to protect against HPV infection in women. Both vaccines can prevent up to 98\% of HPV 16- and 18-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, a precursor to cervical cancer, and the quadrivalent vaccine also prevents vaginal, vulvar and anal dysplasia as well as genital warts
black women have the highest rates of HPV infections
Concerns described by African-American parents include a lack of information on vaccine efficacy and safety, cost, long-term side effects, the belief that vaccination may increase early or unsafe sexual behavior, and concern that the new vaccines are experimental
Blacks who begin the HPV vaccine series continue to have a lower completion rate
Many Haitian women have very little knowledge and hold various misconceptions about HPV including beliefs that transmission may depend on sexual position, that physical sequelae are often manifested with initial infection, and beliefs related to confusion between HPV and HIV, such as HPV causing AIDS, and concerns that the vaccine was intended for Haitians as an experiment, or would be used as a tool for discrimination against the Haitian community
daughters were too young for vaccination, that their children were not sexually active (and that sex at a young age is an “American” trait), that the vaccine may be misinterpreted as permission to engage in sexual activity, that the vaccine was only necessary for women with multiple partners, and that vaccination was not necessary for people who practiced abstinence.
Hispanic women second highest prevalence
High acceptance of HPV vaccination among Hispanics may be due, in part, to favorable views toward vaccines in general, due to personal experience with vaccine preventable diseases in their home countries.16 In addition, cervical cancer is the leading cause of death for women in many parts of Latin America,39 and up to 30\% of Hispanic women know someone who has suffered with this disease.
Reported barriers to vaccination include lack of information and lack of urgency to vaccinate, moral concerns for their daughter’s sexuality, and concern for safety.
higher incidence and mortality rates in low-income minority populations: due to higher rates of HPV exposure, which are culturally and socially mediated and relate to both the age of sexual debut and the number of lifetime partners. Other factors relate to healthcare access and utilization, and reflect both linguistic and cultural barriers including low health literacy and fatalistic beliefs systems-related inequities, with limited access to health care for those who are uninsured or underinsured, leading to differential access to screening, follow-up and treatment for abnormal pap smears, cervical dysplasia, and cancer
HPV vaccination rates for all girls in the United States are well below the rates needed to achieve herd immunity, and though current trends indicate that low-income and minority adolescents in the US have higher rates of initiating HPV vaccination than White and affluent adolescents, minority and low-income girls who start the series are not as likely to complete all three doses as White and affluent girls, and little is known about the effects of incomplete vaccination
Over 84\% of parents of all races and ethnicities use their doctor as their main source of vaccine information, most parents (55–90\%) say they would accept HPV vaccination if offered by their provider
telephone survey of primarily low-income Black and Hispanic families in Los Angeles found that provider recommendation increased the odds of vaccination 48-fold,78 and lack of recommendation from a health care professional was the most frequently reported reasoning for not receiving the HPV vaccination among women found to have precancerous cervical lesions
As practitioner recommendation is crucial to vaccine uptake, and each provider interacts with hundreds to thousands of patients, interventions targeting providers such as academic detailing or performance improvement continuing medical education may be an effective way to improve vaccination rates.
The most common reason given by parents for non-completion was being unaware of the need for subsequent doses; other reasons included side effects, being too busy, and finding the times and locations of the clinics inconvenient. These issues may be more common among low-income and minority women who may have limited English proficiency, low health literacy, hold unskilled jobs with inflexible work hours, or have limited childcare options},

	abstract = {Objective
To examine facilitators and barriers to HPV vaccine uptake in African-American, Haitian, Latina, and White women ages 18–22 and to determine vaccination completion rates among participants over 5 years.

Design
Using semi-structured interviews and medical record review, we assessed HPV knowledge and attitudes towards HPV vaccination among young women. We then determined their subsequent HPV vaccination initiation and completion rates. We used constructs from the Health Belief Model and methods based in grounded theory and content analysis to identify attitudes towards HPV vaccination cues to initiate vaccination, perception of HPV, and how communication about issues of sexuality may impact vaccine uptake.

Participants
We enrolled 132 African-American, Haitian, Latina, and White women aged 18–22 years who visited an urban academic medical center and two affiliated community health centers between the years 2007 and 2012.

Main Outcome Measures
Intent to vaccinate and actual vaccination rates

Results
Of 132 participants, 116 (90\%) stated that they were somewhat or very likely to accept HPV vaccination if offered by their physician, but only 51\% initiated the vaccination over the next 5 years. Seventy-eight percent of those who initiated vaccination completed the 3 doses of the HPV vaccine series. Forty-five percent (45\%, n=50) of the adolescents who started the series completed three doses over a five year period: forty-two percent African-American (n=16), thirty-three percent Haitian (n=13), sixty-three percent Latina (n=10), and sixty-five White young women (n=11) completed the three-dose series. Despite low knowledge, they reported high levels of trust in physicians and were willing to vaccinate if recommended by their physicians.

Conclusion
Desire for HPV vaccination is high among older adolescents, physician recommendation and use of every clinic visit opportunity may improve vaccine uptake in young women. More White young women completed the HPV vaccine series compared with other race and ethnic young women.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We sought to identify attitudes and knowledge of adolescent vaccination recommendations for tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap); quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate (MCV4); and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines among Hispanic, Somali, and Ethiopian/Eritrean communities in King County, Washington.
METHODS: In-person surveys of Hispanic, Somali, and Ethiopian/Eritrean adolescents (n = 45) and parents of adolescents (n = 157), and three focus groups with mothers of 11- to 18-year-olds were conducted to assess knowledge, attitudes, and barriers related to recommended adolescent vaccines. Bivariate analyses of parent survey responses were performed to evaluate possible differences between ethnic groups (chi-square test and Fisher exact test where possible). Findings were used to develop (1) culture-specific written brochures for community members, which addressed misperceptions about adolescent immunizations and related diseases, and (2) a presentation highlighting specific messages for health care providers (HCPs) in the target communities. HCPs were surveyed after delivery of the presentation (n = 20).
RESULTS: We identified barriers to adolescent immunization including: parents' and adolescents' limited awareness of, and misperceptions regarding, recommended adolescent vaccines and vaccine preventable diseases; lack of HCP recommendations for vaccination; and inability to access health information in native languages. Awareness of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate, and human papillomavirus vaccines varied by vaccine and ethnic group. Lack of knowledge of adolescent vaccination recommendations was the main reason given by parents that their adolescents had not been vaccinated. Most parents in the focus groups identified doctors as a trusted source of health information and reported that they would vaccinate their teens if their doctor recommended it. All the surveyed HCPs routinely recommend adolescent vaccines at well-child visits, 55\% at acute visits, and 35\% at injury visits. Eighty percent reported that they would be more likely to recommend HPV vaccine after our on-site presentation.
CONCLUSIONS: A strong recommendation from the physician is a critical factor influencing parents' decision to vaccinate, even when hesitancy exists. Other factors (such as personal experiences with these diseases and religious and cultural beliefs) also influence parents' decisions regarding vaccination. Knowledge of beliefs, misperceptions, and concerns can help inform strategies to improve adolescent vaccine uptake among specific ethnic populations, including the availability of culturally tailored, translated information. Additionally, HCPs may benefit from guidance on communicating with ethnic populations to support meaningful dialogue with families about the risks and benefits of adolescent vaccines.},

	abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S., which leads globally in total cases and deaths. As COVID-19 vaccines are under development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent thousands of additional deaths.
Methods: Using an online platform, we surveyed the U.S. adult population in May 2020 to understand risk perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. These factors were compared across basic demographics.
Findings: Of the 672 participants surveyed, 450 (67\%) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it is recommended for them. Males (72\%) compared to females, older adults (≥55 years; 78\%) compared to younger adults, Asians (81\%) compared to other racial and ethnic groups, and college and/or graduate degree holders (75\%) compared to people with less than a college degree were more likely to accept the vaccine. When comparing reported influenza vaccine uptake to reported acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine: 1) participants who did not complete high school had a very low influenza vaccine uptake (10\%), while 60\% of the same group said they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine; 2) unemployed participants reported lower influenza uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance when compared to those employed or retired; and, 3) Black Americans reported lower influenza vaccine uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance than all other racial groups reported in our study. Lastly, we identified geographic differences with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regions 2 (New York) and 5 (Chicago) reporting less than 50 percent COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.
Interpretation: Although our study found a 67\% acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, there were noticeable demographic and geographical disparities in vaccine acceptance. Before a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced to the U.S., public health officials and policymakers must prioritize effective COVID-19 vaccine-acceptance messaging for all Americans, especially those who are most vulnerable.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A recent study has shown that the national-scale difference in immunization coverage between non-Hispanic white (abbreviated "white") and non-Hispanic African-American (abbreviated "African-American") children aged 19-35 months in the United States has increased by about 1 percentage point annually. We examined how this widening gap differs with geography and income.
METHODS: We used data from the National Immunization Survey, 1998-2003, a national telephone survey. We examined differences between white and African-American children in immunization coverage within income groups (at or above versus below the federal poverty level) for each census region (northeast, south, midwest and west). We tested the hypothesis of constant disparity over time.
RESULTS: Among households at or above the federal poverty level in the northeast census region, disparity is widening (white coverage minus African-American coverage was -0.5 in 1998 but 15.5 in 2003). Among household at or above the federal poverty level in the midwest census region, disparity is narrowing (white coverage minus African-American coverage was 13.9 in 1998 but 2.5 in 2003). We found no significant evidence of a trend in other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Widening national-level disparity in immunization coverage is primarily attributable to trends in the northeast census region. Addressing the widening disparity in coverage requires new strategies that consider current social and economic contexts.},

From June through December 2009, we surveyed a community sample of 309 White and Latina women, ages 15 to 30. We recruited participants from local health care clinics in Des Moines, Iowa. Vaccination status was not significantly different for Whites versus Latinas. The effects of age at first intercourse, mother-daughter communication about values related to sex, and descriptive norms of HPV vaccine uptake were all significantly moderated by ethnicity. The current findings reveal that sociocultural and behavioral factors that affect HPV vaccine uptake do not affect White and Latina women in the same fashion. In the future, public health campaigns about HPV and the HPV vaccine may be more effective if their messages are sensitive to these differences.},

	doi = {10/fps8rf},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racial/ethnic disparities in influenza vaccine coverage of adults aged 65 years and older persist even after controlling for access, healthcare utilization, and socioeconomic status. Differences in attitudes toward vaccination may help explain these disparities. The purpose of this study was to describe patient characteristics and attitudes toward influenza vaccination among whites and African Americans aged 65 years and older, and to examine their effect on racial disparities in vaccination coverage.
METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey of Medicare beneficiaries in five U.S. sites, sampled on race/ethnicity and ZIP code. Multivariate analysis controlling for demographics, healthcare utilization, and attitudes toward influenza vaccination was conducted in 2005 to assess racial disparities in vaccine coverage during the 2003-2004 season.
RESULTS: The analysis included 1859 white and 1685 African-American respondents; 79\% of whites versus 50\% of African Americans reported influenza vaccination in the past year (p {\textless} 0.00001). Both vaccinated and unvaccinated African Americans were significantly less likely than whites to report positive attitudes toward influenza vaccination. Even among respondents with provider recommendations, respondents with positive attitudes were more likely to be vaccinated than those with negative attitudes. After multivariate adjustment, African Americans had significantly lower odds of influenza vaccination than whites (odds ratio = 0.55, 95\% confidence interval = 0.42-0.72).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant gap in vaccination coverage between African Americans and whites persisted even after controlling for specific respondent attitudes. Future research should focus on other factors such as vaccine-seeking behavior.},

Utilizing a 2015 national survey of African American and White adults (n = 1630), we explore multiple dimensions of trust related to influenza immunization, including generalized trust, trust in the flu vaccine, and trust in the vaccine production process. We find African Americans report lower trust than Whites across all trust measures. When considering demographic, racial, and ideological predictors, generalized trust shows statistically significant effects on both trust in the flu vaccine and trust in the vaccine process. When controlling for demographic, racial, and ideological variables, higher generalized trust was significantly associated with higher trust in the flu vaccine and the vaccine process. When controlling for generalized trust, in addition to the baseline covariates, psychosocial predictors (i.e. risk perception, social norms, knowledge) are significant predictors of trust in flu vaccine and trust in the vaccine process, with significant differences by race. These findings suggest that trust in vaccination is complex, and that significant differences in trust between White and African American adults may be contributing to disparities in influenza immunization.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parental concerns about immunization safety have been covered widely in the media and on the Internet and have been correlated in some studies with under-immunization and the late receipt of immunizations.
OBJECTIVES: Phase 1: To (1) measure the prevalence of parents with immunization safety concern, specifically those with high-level concern, (2) determine demographic characteristics and attitudes typical for this subgroup of parents, and (3) determine factors that influence such parents, nevertheless, to have their children immunized. Phase 2: To further explore the racial/ethnic difference found in the first-phase results, specifically to compare the immunization attitudes of Hispanic (both black and white) and non-Hispanic black parents with those of non-Hispanic white parents.
METHODS: ConsumerStyles (2004) survey data of a nationwide panel of U.S. adults were analyzed in January 2006. In Phase 1, bivariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with parental concerns about immunization safety. In Phase 2, logistic regression was used to compare immunization attitudes among non-Hispanic black; Hispanic (both black and white); and non-Hispanic white parents.
RESULTS: The response rate was 62\% (6207/10,000); analysis was restricted to the 2937 (47\%) respondents who were parents with a child aged 18 years or younger; 634 (21\%) responded with the highest level of concern, 5 on a 1-to-5-point scale. Demographics (Hispanic ethnicity/nonwhite race, low income, and less education) and negative attitudes toward immunization and the child's healthcare provider were significantly associated with high-level concern. Seventy-two percent of parents with high-level concern responded that the risk of a child getting a disease was their primary reason for having their child immunized, while 17\% listed state laws requiring immunizations for school/daycare entry. Importantly, black parents were more likely than white parents to have negative attitudes toward immunizations and their child's healthcare provider.
CONCLUSIONS: One fifth of parents reported high-level concern with the safety of childhood immunizations. To prevent the erosion of childhood immunization rates, healthcare providers need to learn how to recognize and address these concerns.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the efficacy of a culturally relevant, community-based HPV vaccination intervention among Latinx immigrant mothers with daughters aged 9-12 in Alabama.
METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial with "place of residence" (e.g., apartment complexes, trailer parks) as the unit of randomization that evaluated two interventions: 1) promotion of HPV vaccination and 2) promotion of healthy eating and appropriate nutrition label interpretation. Identical baseline/post/7-month follow up questionnaires were completed by all participants and both interventions consisted of four group sessions and one individual session. A total of 40 locations were randomized with 317 mother-daughter dyads enrolled in the study between May 2013 and October 2017.
RESULTS: A total of 278 mother-daughter dyads met full eligibility and initiated the intervention/control participation. Retention rate overall was 93.2\% (92.6\% for the intervention arm and 93.7\% for the control arm). Daughters in the intervention arm were significantly more likely to receive one, two, and three doses of HPV vaccine than daughters in the control arm p {\textless} 0.001). In multivariate analyses, mothers in the intervention arm had a six times greater odds of vaccinating daughters with the first dose (OR = 5.96, 95\% CI: 3.38, 10.49), eight times greater odds of vaccinating daughters with the second dose (OR = 8.09, 95\% CI: 4.0, 16.35), and more than 16 times greater odds of completing the three-dose HPV vaccine series than mothers in the control arm after adjusting for mother's age, time in the U.S., income, and daughter's health insurance status (OR = 16.5, 95\% CI: 5.73, 47.48). Only perceived risk of their daughters' future HPV infection remained significant as a predictor of three-dose HPV vaccination completion (OR = 0.69, 95\% CI: 0.23, 2.1).
CONCLUSIONS: A theory-driven, culturally-relevant intervention developed through extensive formative assessments in collaboration with community members can effectively promote HPV vaccination among 9-12 years of age daughters of Latina immigrants.},

Interventions to increase uptake of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in minority youth have the potential to reduce disparities in HPV infection and HPV-related cancers. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of interventions to increase HPV vaccine uptake, measured as vaccine series initiation and series completion, among adolescents and young adults, aged 9-26 years old, identifying as a racial and ethnic minority or sexual and gender minority (SGM) group in high-income countries. Of the 3013 citations produced by a systematic search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) in November 2018, nine studies involving 9749 participants were selected for inclusion. All studies were conducted in the United States and were published from 2015 to 2018. Interventions utilized education, vaccine appointment reminders, and negotiated interviewing to increase vaccination. Participants were Black or African American (44.4\%), Asian (33.3\%), Hispanic or Latinx (22.2\%), American Indian or Alaska Native (11.1\%), and SGM (22.2\%). Studies enrolled parent-child dyads (33.3\%), parents alone (11.1\%), and youth alone (55.6\%). Vaccine series initiation ranged from 11.1\% to 84\% and series completion ranged from 5.6\% to 74.2\% post-intervention. Educational and appointment reminder interventions may improve HPV vaccine series initiation and completion in minority youth in the U.S. Given the lack of high quality, adequately powered studies, further research is warranted to identify effective strategies for improving HPV vaccine uptake for minority populations.},

We sought to characterize and explain racial and ethnic differences in HPV vaccination. We systematically searched PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science to identify US studies through mid-2017 reporting associations of race and ethnicity with HPV vaccination. We identified 118 studies (n = 3,095,486) published in English that reported HPV vaccine initiation or follow-through in the US from which we could calculate effect sizes. We used random effects meta-analysis to synthesize effect sizes for comparisons of Whites or non-Hispanics to Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, or all minority groups combined. Studies showed no racial or ethnic differences in HPV vaccine initiation overall. However, when restricting to studies using provider-verified vaccination data, minorities were 6.1\% [3.3\%-8.8\%] more likely than Whites to initiate HPV vaccination. Advantages were larger for Hispanics, males, and younger samples (age {\textless} 18). In contrast, minorities were 8.6\% [5.6\%, 11.7\%], less likely than Whites to follow-through with the full HPV vaccine series, a disparity present across all participant and study characteristics. More recent studies found larger advantages for racial and ethnic minorities in HPV vaccine initiation and smaller disparities in follow-through. In summary, high-quality studies found racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to initiate but less likely to follow-through with HPV vaccination, a clear finding that self-report studies obscure. Higher HPV vaccine initiation among minorities suggests potential reductions in HPV cancer disparities.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the acceptability of the influenza A (H1N1) and seasonal vaccinations immediately following government manufacture approval to gauge potential product uptake in minority communities. We studied correlates of vaccine acceptance including attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and influenza immunization experiences, and sought to identify communication approaches to increase influenza vaccine coverage in community settings.
METHODS: Adults ≥18 years participated in a cross-sectional survey from September through December 2009. Venue-based sampling was used to recruit participants of racial and ethnic minorities.
RESULTS: The sample (N=503) included mostly lower income (81.9\%, n=412) participants and African Americans (79.3\%, n=399). Respondents expressed greater acceptability of the H1N1 vaccination compared to seasonal flu immunization (t=2.86, p=0.005) although H1N1 vaccine acceptability was moderately low (38\%, n=191). Factors associated with acceptance of the H1N1 vaccine included positive attitudes about immunizations [OR=0.23, CI (0.16, 0.33)], community perceptions of H1N1 [OR=2.15, CI (1.57, 2.95)], and having had a flu shot in the past 5 years [OR=2.50, CI (1.52, 4.10). The factors associated with acceptance of the seasonal flu vaccine included positive attitudes about immunization [OR=0.43, CI (0.32, 0.59)], community perceptions of H1N1 [OR=1.53, CI (1.16, 2.01)], and having had the flu shot in the past 5 years [OR=3.53, CI (2.16, 5.78)]. Participants were most likely to be influenced to take a flu shot by physicians [OR=1.94, CI (1.31, 2.86)]. Persons who obtained influenza vaccinations indicated that Facebook (χ(2)=11.7, p=0.02) and Twitter (χ(2)=18.1, p=0.001) could be useful vaccine communication channels and that churches (χ(2)=21.5, p{\textless}0.001) and grocery stores (χ(2)=21.5, p{\textless}0.001) would be effective "flu shot stops" in their communities.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population, positive vaccine attitudes and community perceptions, along with previous flu vaccination, were associated with H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccine acceptance. Increased immunization coverage in this community may be achieved through physician communication to dispel vaccine conspiracy beliefs and discussion about vaccine protection via social media and in other community venues.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: People living with chronic health conditions exhibit higher risk for developing severe complications from influenza according to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. Although racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination have been documented, it has not been comprehensively determined whether similar disparities are present among the adult population with at least one such condition.
OBJECTIVE: To study if racial and ethnic disparities in relation to influenza vaccination are present in adults suffering from at least one chronic condition and if such inequalities differ between age groups.
METHODS: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2011-2012) was used to study the adult population (age ≥18) who had at least one chronic health condition. Baseline differences in population traits across racial and ethnic groups were identified using a chi-square test. This was conducted among various age groups. In addition, survey logistic regression was utilized to produce odds ratios of receiving influenza vaccination annually between racial and ethnic groups.
RESULTS: The total sample consisted of 15,499 adults living with at least one chronic health condition. The numbers of non-Hispanic whites (whites), non-Hispanic blacks (blacks), and Hispanics were 8,658, 3,585, and 3,256, respectively. Whites (59.93\%) were found to have a higher likelihood of self-reporting their receipt of the influenza vaccine in comparison to the black (48.54\%) and Hispanic (48.65\%) groups (P{\textless}0.001). When examining persons aged 50-64 years and ≥65 years, it was noted that the black (54.99\%, 62.72\%) and Hispanic (53.54\%, 64.48\%) population had lower rates of influenza vaccine coverage than the white population (59.22\%, 77.89) (both P{\textless}0.0001). No significant differences between whites and the blacks or Hispanics were found among the groups among adults between 18 and 49 inclusive (P{\textgreater}0.05). After controlling for patient characteristics, the difference in influenza vaccine coverage between whites and the minority groups were no longer significant for adults aged 50-64 years. However, the difference were still statistically significant for those aged ≥65 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, there are significant disparities in influenza vaccination by race and ethnicity for adults over 65 years with at least one chronic health condition. Future research is needed to help develop more targeted interventions to address these issues and improve influenza vaccination rates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As public health leaders prepare for possible future influenza pandemics, the rapid spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza highlights the need to focus on measures the public can adopt to help slow disease transmission. Such measures may relate to hygiene (e.g., hand washing), social distancing (e.g., avoiding places where many people gather), and pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., vaccination). Given the disproportionate impact of public health emergencies on minority communities in the United States, it is important to understand whether there are differences in acceptance across racial/ethnic groups that could lead to targeted and more effective policies and communications.
OBJECTIVES: This study explores racial/ethnic differences in the adoption of preventive behaviors during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Data are from a national telephone poll conducted March 17 to April 11, 2010, among a representative sample of 1123 white, 330 African American, 317 Hispanic, 268 Asian, and 262 American Indian/Alaska Native adults in the USA.
RESULTS: People in at least one racial/ethnic minority group were more likely than whites to adopt several behaviors related to hygiene, social distancing, and healthcare access, including increased hand washing and talking with a healthcare provider (P-values {\textless}0.05). Exceptions included avoiding others with influenza-like illnesses and receiving 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccinations. After we controlled the data for socioeconomic status, demographic factors, healthcare access, and illness- and vaccine-related attitudes, nearly all racial/ethnic differences in behaviors persisted.
CONCLUSIONS: Minority groups appear to be receptive to several preventive behaviors, but barriers to vaccination are more pervasive.},

	volume = {29},
	issn = {1525-1497},
	doi = {10/f6rfbt},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination remains below the federally targeted levels outlined in Healthy People 2020. Compared to non-Hispanic whites, racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to be vaccinated for influenza, despite being at increased risk for influenza-related complications and death. Also, vaccinated minorities are more likely to receive influenza vaccinations in office-based settings and less likely to use non-medical vaccination locations compared to non-Hispanic white vaccine users.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the number of "missed opportunities" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings by race and ethnicity and the magnitude of potential vaccine uptake and reductions in racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination if these "missed opportunities" were eliminated.
DESIGN: National cross-sectional Internet survey administered between March 4 and March 14, 2010 in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Non-Hispanic black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic white adults living in the United States (N = 3,418).
MAIN MEASURES: We collected data on influenza vaccination, frequency and timing of healthcare visits, and self-reported compliance with a potential provider recommendation for vaccination during the 2009-2010 influenza season. "Missed opportunities" for seasonal influenza vaccination in office-based settings were defined as the number of unvaccinated respondents who reported at least one healthcare visit in the Fall and Winter of 2009-2010 and indicated their willingness to get vaccinated if a healthcare provider strongly recommended it. "Potential vaccine uptake" was defined as the sum of actual vaccine uptake and "missed opportunities."
KEY RESULTS: The frequency of "missed opportunities" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings was significantly higher among racial and ethnic minorities than non-Hispanic whites. Eliminating these "missed opportunities" could have cut racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination by roughly one half.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Racial disparities in adult flu vaccination rates persist with African Americans falling below Whites in vaccine acceptance. Although the literature has examined traditional variables including barriers, access, attitudes, among others, there has been virtually no examination of the extent to which racial factors including racial consciousness, fairness, and discrimination may affect vaccine attitudes and behaviors.
METHODS: We contracted with GfK to conduct an online, nationally representative survey with 819 African American and 838 White respondents. Measures included risk perception, trust, vaccine attitudes, hesitancy and confidence, novel measures on racial factors, and vaccine behavior.
RESULTS: There were significant racial differences in vaccine attitudes, risk perception, trust, hesitancy and confidence. For both groups, racial fairness had stronger direct effects on the vaccine-related variables with more positive coefficients associated with more positive vaccine attitudes. Racial consciousness in a health care setting emerged as a more powerful influence on attitudes and beliefs, particularly for African Americans, with higher scores on racial consciousness associated with lower trust in the vaccine and the vaccine process, higher perceived vaccine risk, less knowledge of flu vaccine, greater vaccine hesitancy, and less confidence in the flu vaccine. The effect of racial fairness on vaccine behavior was mediated by trust in the flu vaccine for African Americans only (i.e., higher racial fairness increased trust in the vaccine process and thus the probability of getting a flu vaccine). The effect of racial consciousness and discrimination for African Americans on vaccine uptake was mediated by perceived vaccine risk and flu vaccine knowledge.
CONCLUSIONS: Racial factors can be a useful new tool for understanding and addressing attitudes toward the flu vaccine and actual vaccine behavior. These new concepts can facilitate more effective tailored and targeted vaccine communications.},
